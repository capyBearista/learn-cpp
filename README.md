Projects seen here are based on freeCodeCamp's [free C++ programming course](https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o)! Not all lessons from the video will have a file here as I'm essentially just filling in gaps in my knowledge rather than learning C++ from scratch.

This repo exists largely for my own note-taking, but I hope my comments in each .cpp file can help you!
